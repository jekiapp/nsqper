Although Topic Master is built with access control in mind, it can also be used without requiring user authentication. This allows small teams to quickly set up and use various features without configuring user access management. However, any features that require user login will be unavailable in this mode.

## All Topics

In this menu, user can view all synchronized topics. By clicking on a topic, user will be taken to the topic detail page. Here, user can perform all available actions as long as the entity is not owned by a specific group (indicated by `Group owner: None`).

## Signup

Non-logged-in users can sign up by clicking the `login/signup` button. Users should select the group they wish to join. These group options must be set up in advance by the `root` userâ€”contact your administrator if your group is not listed.

After submitting a signup request, user can share the application URL with an assignee to expedite the approval process. Alternatively, assignees can access signup applications from the ticket page. By default, all users in the root group and the admin of the selected group will be assigned to approve signup applications.
